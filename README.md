# Portable Asp.net Web Server
A small web server based on the [Cassini++ Project](https://cassinipp.codeplex.com/) for portable deployments. 

Hasn't been worked on since 2013.

Does not require installation and is easy to maintain. It can run normal webform as well as MVC applications. 
Created in C# and Windows Forms.
